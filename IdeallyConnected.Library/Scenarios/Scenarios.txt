the amount of people using the app in the vicinity. The user can then test the app by
inputing or choosing a detail about themselves to compare against other candidates in the
vicinity in which the user can connect with. The user will be prompted if there are any
matches, else { insert sad face }.
The user can then choose to register for the app.

any other process.
