## Ideally Connected
Goal: create an application in which users can compare and analyze each other based on they're provided data (which would initially consist of programming languages they know and software that they use). 

### Frameworks and API usage
- ASP.NET (Framework 4.6.1) Web API with Entity Framework 6.1.3
- AngularJS 1.5.8
- D3.js (latest hosted version)

### Checklist *(ordered in descending priority)*
- [x] Create DB schema: *Users, Programming Languages, Skills, Software*
- [ ] View with drop down list of Users and their relevant information
- [ ] Chat/ messenger
- [ ] Local network topology visualization

Latest development can be seen in 'Develop' branch. 'RestartDevelopment' branch has now withered.

### Development Protocols
I prefer clear, self-documenting code than code that just works. It's better to write clear and less
performant code first and then focus on improving performance.
